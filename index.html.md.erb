###About

The [Pivotal App Distribution service](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-app-distribution) provides [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) users with a release process for testing and sharing mobile apps currently in development. Current mobile platforms supported include iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone.

A typical use case is as follows:

1. In the App Distribution web portal, a developer creates a ‘release’ of an app (currently in development) for QA testers. Developers can add release notes, known issues, lists of supported devices and OS versions, etc.

1. The QA testing team is notified of the release via email. They can then install (via over-the-air download) and test the app on device. Pending successful completion of testing, QA then approves the release for distribution.

1. Once approved, the developer can then distribute the release to a larger group of team members, which can include beta testers, project stakeholders, etc.
